A reusable barrier where a fixed number of threads wait for each other before moving to the next phase.

How it works

Initialized with number of parties

Each thread calls await()

When all threads arrive, barrier opens

✔ Automatically resets (cyclic)

Example
CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3,
    () -> System.out.println("All threads reached barrier"));

Runnable task = () -> {
    doWork();
    barrier.await();
    nextPhase();
};

Typical use cases

Parallel algorithms with phases

Simulation steps

Multiplayer game rounds

Batch processing stages

🔍 Key Differences (Interview Table)
Aspect	CountDownLatch	CyclicBarrier
Reusability	❌ One-time	✅ Reusable
Who waits	One or more threads	All participating threads
Trigger	Counter reaches zero	All threads reach barrier
Reset	❌ No	✅ Yes
Optional action	❌ No	✅ Yes (barrier action)
Direction	Workers → main thread	Peer-to-peer
