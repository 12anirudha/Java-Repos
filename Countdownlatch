🔹 CountDownLatch
What it does

A one-time gate that allows one or more threads to wait until a counter reaches zero.

How it works

Initialized with a count

Worker threads call countDown()

Waiting thread(s) call await()

When count hits 0, waiting threads proceed

❌ Cannot be reused

Example
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

executor.submit(() -> { task1(); latch.countDown(); });
executor.submit(() -> { task2(); latch.countDown(); });
executor.submit(() -> { task3(); latch.countDown(); });

latch.await(); // waits until all 3 finish
System.out.println("All tasks done");
